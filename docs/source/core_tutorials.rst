Pyobjus API tutorial
====================

This part of documentation covers tutorials related to API of pyobjus

Using dylib_manager
-------------------

As you now, you need to load code into pyobjus so it can actually find appropriate class with autoclass function.

Maybe you want to write some Objective C code, and you want to load it into pyobjus, or you want
to use some exising `.dylib` or sommething similar. 

Those problems will solve pyobjus dylib_manager. Currently it has few functions, so let's see what we can do with 
them.

make_dylib and load_dylib functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the first example, let's say that we want to write our class in Objective C, and after that we want
to load that class into pyobjus. Okey, let's write class::

    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

    @interface ObjcClass : NSObject {
    }
    - (void) printFromObjectiveC;
    @end

    @implementation ObjcClass

    - (void) printFromObjectiveC {
            printf("Hello from Objective C\n");
    }

    @end

Next step is to make .dylib for this class, and load that .dylib into pyobjus. Suppose that we have saved previous code 
into `objc_lib.m` file.

With pyobjus you can compile `objc_lib.m` into `objc_lib.dylib` in the following way::

    make_dylib('objc_lib.m', frameworks=['Foundation'], options=['-current_version', '1.0'])

With this we say to pyobjus to link `objc_lib.m` with Foundation framework, and we also say that we want to set
`-current_version` option to `1.0`. You can also specify others frameworks and options if you want, 
just add elements to array.

Previous command will result with `objc_lib.dylib` file in the same directory as the `objc_lib.m` file.
If you want to save it to another dir, and with different name, you can call `make_dylib` on this way::

    make_dylib('objc_lib.m', frameworks=['Foundation'], out='/path/to/dylib/dylib_name.dylib')

After you make .dylib with make_dylib function, you can load code from .dylib into pyobjus on following way::

    load_dylib('objc_lib.dylib')

    # or if you specified anothed loation and name for .dylib
    # load_dylib('/path/to/dylib/dylib_name.dylib')

Great, we have .dylib create, loaded into pyobjus, we can use ObjcClass from our `objc_lib.m` file::

    ObjcClass = autoclass('ObjcClass')
    o_instance = ObjcClass.alloc().init()
    o_instance.printFromObjectiveC()

This will output with::

    >>> Hello from Objective C

load_framework function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There often can be situations when you need to load classes into pyobjus which don't belongs to 
Foundation framework, for example you want to load class from AppKit framework.

In those cases you have available load_framework function of dylib_manager.

So let's see one simple example of using this function::

    from pyobjus.dylib_manager import load_framework, INCLUDE
    load_framework(INCLUDE.AppKit)

You may wonder what is the INCLUDE, and can we load all Frameworks in this way?
So INCLUDE is enum, which contains paths to Frameworks. Currently INCLUDE contains paths to following frameworks::

If Framework path which you want to load isn't present in INCLUDE enum, you can specify it manualy.
Let's say that path to AppKit isn't available via INCLUDE enum. You can load Framework on following way::

    load_framework('/System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework')


Using struct types
------------------

Pyobjus currently support ``NSRange``, ``NSPoint``, ``NSSize`` and ``NSRect`` structures. They are defined via ``ctypes.Structure`` type.

Consider following. You have Objective C class with name ObjcClass, and useRange: method of that class which is defined in this way::

    - (void) useRange:(NSRange)r {
        printf("location: %ld, length: %ld\n", r.location, r.length);
    }

So, if you want to call this method from Python, you can do sommething like this::

    from pyobjus.objc_py_types import NSRange
    from pyobjus import autoclass

    ObjcClass = autoclass('ObjcClass')
    o_cls = ObjcClass.alloc().init()
    range = NSRange(10, 20)
    o_cls.useRange_(range)

This will output with::

    >>> location: 10, length: 20

The simmilar situation is with returning and using Objective C structure types. Let's say that ObjcClass has another method, with name makeRange::

    - (NSRange) makeRange {
        NSRange range;
        range.length = 123;
        range.location = 456;
        return range;
    }

Using this method from Python is really simple. Let's say that we have included it from previous Python code example::

    range = o_cls.makeRange()
    print range.length
    print range.location

And this will output with::

    >>> 123
    >>> 456

As you can see dealing with Objective C structs from pyobjus is simple.

On the end of this section let's see how to create ``NSRect`` type from example::

    point = NSPoint(30, 50)
    size = NSSize(60, 70)
    rect = NSRect(point, size)

Dealing with pointers
---------------------

As you know C has very powerful feature, with name pointers. Objective C is superset of C language, so Objective C also has this great feature.

But wait, we are in Python, how we can deal with pointers from Python???

Passing pointers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Relax, pyobjus is doing job for you here. I think that is the best way is to view some example of that. So, let's expand our ObjcClass class with another method::

    - (void) useRangePtr:(NSRange*)r_p {
        NSRange r = r_p[0];
        printf("location: %ld, length: %ld\n", r.location, r.length);
    }

In previous examples you have seen example of making ``NSRange`` from Python, and you have sent value of ``NSRange`` type. But now we have situation when method accepts pointer to some type.

With pyobjus, you can call method in following way::

    range = NSRange(40, 80)
    o_cls.useRangePtr_(range)

And this will output::

    >>> location:40, length: 80

So what have happened here? We pass argument on the same way as with ``useRange:`` method.

Pyobjus would know if method would accept pointer on type, or accept value. If method accepts pointer on type, pyobjus will make pointer of that type, 
and put passed value to location on which previously created pointer points.
So with this, you don't need to pay attention about argument types if they are pointers or values on some type.

You can also return pointers to types from Objective C methods. Let's add another method to ObjcClass::

    - (NSRange*) makeRangePtr {
        NSRange *r_p = malloc(sizeof(NSRange));
        NSRange r;
        r.length = 123;
        r.location = 567;
        *r_p = r;
        return r_p;
    }

As you can see, this method makes ``NSRange`` pointer, assigning value to it, and at the end, it returns pointer to user.
From Python you can consume this method in this way::

    range_ptr = o_cls.makeRangePtr()
    # let we see actual type of returned object
    print range_ptr

This will output following::

    >>> <pyobjus.ObjcReferenceToType object at 0x10f34bcb0>

So here we can see another type -> ObjcReferenceToType. When we have method which returns pointer to some type, pyobjus will wrap that pointer with ObjcReferenceToType object,
so object now contains actual address of C pointer. We can pass that type to function which accepts pointer to type.

Example::

    # note that range_ptr is of ObjcReferenceToType type
    o_cls.useRangePtr_(range_ptr)

But you may wonder now how to dereference pointer to get actual value?

Answer is....use dereference function

Dereferencing pointers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To dereference pointer use dereference function::

    from pyobjus import dereference

If function returns pointer to some known type, with other words, type isn't void*, you can use dereference function in this way::

    range_ptr = o_cls.makeRangePtr()
    range = dereference(range_ptr)

Pyobjus will parse returned signature from method signature, so it will know in which type to convert pointer value.
If you return void pointer, you will need to specify type in which you want to pyobjus convert actual value on which pointer points.

Now we can add method::

    - (void*) makeIntVoidPtr {
        int *a = malloc(sizeof(int));
        *a = 12345;
        return (void*)a;
    }

Now we can retrieve value, and dereference it::

    int_ptr = o_cls.makeIntVoidPtr()
    int_val = dereference(int_ptr, of_type=ObjcInt)
    print int_val

This will output with::

    >>> 12345

Notice that you can specify ``of_type`` optional argument although methods returns ``NSRange`` pointer. 
With this you will be sure that pyobjus will convert value to that type.

Here is the list of possible types::

    'ObjcChar', 
    'ObjcInt', 
    'ObjcShort', 
    'ObjcLong', 
    'ObjcLongLong', 
    'ObjcUChar', 
    'ObjcUInt', 
    'ObjcUShort', 
    'ObjcULong', 
    'ObjcULongLong', 
    'ObjcFloat', 
    'ObjcDouble', 
    'ObjcBool', 
    'ObjcBOOL', 
    'ObjcVoid', 
    'ObjcString', 
    'ObjcClassInstance', 
    'ObjcClass', 
    'ObjcSelector', 
    'ObjcMethod'

Those already listed types are placed inside pyobjus module, so you can import them in following way::

    from pyobjus import ObjcChar, ObjcInt # etc...

Inside ``pyobjus.objc_py_types`` module are placed structs and unions types. This is list of them::

    'NSRange',
    'NSPoint',
    'NSRect',
    'NSSize'

You can import them with::

    from pyobjus.objc_py_types import NSRange # etc...

Objective C <-> pyobjus literals
--------------------------------

If you are fammiliar with Objective C literals, then you know that is great feature, because literals reduces amount of code to write.
You may wonder is there some equvivalent with pyobjus. The answer is YES.

I think that next example will illustrate how to use pyobjus literals, and what are the Objective C equvivalents::

    from pyobjus import *

    # In following examples will be demonstrated pyobjus literals feature
    # First line will denote native objective c literals, and second pyobjus literls
    # SOURCE: http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ObjectiveCLiterals.html

    # NSNumber *theLetterZ = @'Z';          // equivalent to [NSNumber numberWithChar:'Z']
    objc_c('Z')

    # NSNumber *fortyTwo = @42;             // equivalent to [NSNumber numberWithInt:42]
    objc_i(42)

    # NSNumber *fortyTwoUnsigned = @42U;    // equivalent to [NSNumber numberWithUnsignedInt:42U]
    objc_ui(42)

    # NSNumber *fortyTwoLong = @42L;        // equivalent to [NSNumber numberWithLong:42L]
    objc_l(42)

    # NSNumber *fortyTwoLongLong = @42LL;   // equivalent to [NSNumber numberWithLongLong:42LL]
    objc_ll(42)

    # NSNumber *piFloat = @3.141592654F;    // equivalent to [NSNumber numberWithFloat:3.141592654F]
    objc_f(3.141592654)

    # NSNumber *piDouble = @3.1415926535;   // equivalent to [NSNumber numberWithDouble:3.1415926535]
    objc_d(3.1415926535)

    # NSNumber *yesNumber = @YES;           // equivalent to [NSNumber numberWithBool:YES]
    objc_b(True)

    # NSNumber *noNumber = @NO;             // equivalent to [NSNumber numberWithBool:NO]
    objc_b(False)

    # NSArray *array = @[ @"Hello", NSApp, [NSNumber numberWithInt:42] ];
    objc_arr(objc_str('Hello'), objc_str('some str'), objc_i(42))

    # NSDictionary *dictionary = @{
    #    @"name" : NSUserName(),
    #    @"date" : [NSDate date],
    #    @"processInfo" : [NSProcessInfo processInfo]
    # };
    objc_dict({
        'name': objc_str('User name'),
        'date': autoclass('NSDate').date(),
        'processInfo': autoclass('NSProcessInfo').processInfo()
    })

    # NSString *string = @"some string";
    objc_str('some string')

I think that you unserstand on which rules are build names for these literals. So we add prefix ``objc_``,
followed with letter/letters which denotes Objective C type, for examples i for ``int``, f for ``float``, arr for ``NSArray``, dict for ``NSDictionary``, etc...


Unknown types
-------------

Let's say that we have defined following structures in our ObjcClass.

Note that we haven't specify type of structs, so their types will be missing in method signatures::

    typedef struct {
        float a;
        int b;
        NSRect rect;
    } unknown_str_new;

    typedef struct {
        int a;
        int b;
        NSRect rect;
        unknown_str_new u_str;
    } unknown_str;

Let's play. Suppose that we have defined following objective c method::

    - (unknown_str) makeUnknownStr {
        unknown_str str;
        str.a = 10;
        str.rect = NSMakeRect(20, 30, 40, 50);
        str.u_str.a = 2.0;
        str.u_str.b = 4;
        return str;
    }

Purpose of this method is to make unknown type struct, and adding some values to it's members
If you see debug logs of pyobjus, you will notice that method returns following type::

    {?=ii{CGRect={CGPoint=dd}{CGSize=dd}}{?=fi{CGRect={CGPoint=dd}{CGSize=dd}}}}

From this we can see that method returns some type, which contains two integers, and two structs. One struct
is ``CGRect``, and another is some unknown type, which contains float, integer and ``CGRect`` struct
So, if user haven't defined this struct, pyobjus can generate this type for him. Let's call this function::

    ret_type = o_cls.makeUnknownStr()

But wait, how will pyobjus know about field names in struct, because from method signature we know 
only types, not actual names? Well, pyobjus will generate some 'random' names in alphabetical order.

In our case, first member will have name 'a', second will have name 'b', and third name ``CGRect``,
which is used because can help user as indicator of type if actual type is missing. Last one is another 
unknown type, so pyobjus will generate name for him and it will have name 'c'. 

Notice that in case of ``CGRect``, memeber will have ``origin`` and ``size`` members, because it is already defined, 
and we know info about its members. But for last member, pyobjus will continue recursive generating names 
for its members.

Maybe you are asking yourself now, how will you know actual generated name, so pyobjus will help you with this.
There is ``getMembers`` function, which returns name and type of some field in struct::

    print ret_type.getMembers()

Python will output with::

    >>> [('a', <class 'ctypes.c_int'>), ('b', <class 'ctypes.c_int'>), ('CGRect', <class 'pyobjus.objc_py_types.NSRect'>), ('c', <class 'pyobjus.objc_py_types.UnknownType'>)]

If you want to provide your name fields, you can do in this way::

    ret_type = o_cls.makeUnknownStr(members=['first', 'second', 'struct_field', 'tmp_field'])

And if we now run ``getMembers`` command, it will result with::

    [('first', <class 'ctypes.c_int'>), ('second', <class 'ctypes.c_int'>), ('struct_field', <class 'pyobjus.objc_py_types.NSRect'>), ('tmp_field', <class 'pyobjus.objc_py_types.UnknownType'>)]

If you don't need types, only names, you can call method in following way::

    print ret_type.getMembers(only_fields=True)

Python will output with::

    >>> ['a', 'b', 'CGRect', 'c']

Also, if you want to know only names, you can get it on following way::

    print ret_type.getMembers(only_types=True)

Python will output with::

    >>> [<class 'ctypes.c_int'>, <class 'ctypes.c_int'>, <class 'pyobjus.objc_py_types.NSRect'>, <class 'pyobjus.objc_py_types.UnknownType'>]

If you want to use returned type to pass it as argument to some function there will be some problems. 
Pyobjus uses ctypes structures, so we can get actual pointer to C structure from Python object,
but if we want to get correct values of passed arg, we need to cast pointer to appropriate type.

If type is defined in ``pyobjus/objc_cy_types.pxi`` pyobjus will convert it for us, but if it isn't, we will need to convert
it by ourselfs. For example internally in Objective C method where we are passing struct value. Lets see example of this::

    - (void) useUnknownStr:(void*)str_vp {
        unknown_str *str_p = (unknown_str*)str_vp;
        unknown_str str = str_p[0];
        printf("%f\n", str.rect.origin.x);
    }

And from Python::

    o_cls.useUnknownStr_(ret_type)

And Python will output with::

    >>> 20.00

Using class
-----------

As you know, ``class`` is Python keyword, so that might be a problem.

Let's say that we want to get Class type for ``NSString`` instance...

We can use following::

    NSString = autoclass('NSString')
    text = NSString.alloc().init()
    text.oclass()

This will return::

    <pyobjus.ObjcClass object at 0x1057361b0>

So, now we can use isKindOfClass: method::

    text.isKindOfClass_(NSString)

This will output ``True``. Let's see another example::

    NSArray = autoclass('NSArray')
    text.isKindOfClass_(NSArray)

And this will output ``False``.

So, as you can see, if you want to use ``class`` with pyobjus, you will need to use ``some_object.oclass()`` method.

Using @selector
---------------

There may be situations when you need to use ``@selector``, which is Objective C feature. With pyobjus you can also get SEL type for method. Let's say that we want to get SEL for init method::

    from pyobjus import selector
    selector('init')

This will output with::

    <pyobjus.ObjcSelector object at 0x1057361c8>

So, as you can see, instead of using this ``@selector(init)`` with Objective C, you will use ``selector('init')`` with pyobjus and Python to get SEL type for some method.

If you want get SEL for ``initWithUTF8String:`` you can use::

    selector('initWithUTF8String:')

Other cases are the same for all methods.

Using enum types
----------------

Pyobjus currently support ``NSComparisonResult`` and ``NSStringEncoding`` enums. If you want to use some others, you need to expand pyobjus with additional types by adding then into ``pyobjus/objc_py_types.py`` file.

But, let we see how to use supported enum types with pyobjus. Consider following example::

    from pyobjus import autoclass, objc_str
    from pyobjus.objc_py_types import NSComparisonResult

    def enum_example():
        text = objc_str('some text')
        text_to_compare = objc_str('some text')
        if text.compare_(text_to_compare) == NSComparisonResult.NSOrderedSame:
            print 'the same strings'

        text_to_compare = objc_str('text')
        if text.compare_(text_to_compare) == NSComparisonResult.NSOrderedAscending:
            print 'NSOrderedAscending strings'

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        enum_example()

You can see that we use ``NSComparisonResult`` enum in above example to compare two strings. Enum is defined in this way::

    NSComparisonResult = enum("NSComparisonResult", NSOrderedAscending=-1, NSOrderedSame=0, NSOrderedDescending=1)

The first argument of ``enum`` function is name of new enum type, and rest of arguments are fields declarations of that enum. As you can see it is preety simple to declare enum with pyobjus, so you can add new enum types to pyobjus.

Using vararg methods
--------------------

As you know, Objective C support vararg (Variable Arguments) methods, so it will be great if you can use vararg methods from pyobjus. Fortunately you can.

Let's we say that we want to use ``arrayWithObjects:`` method, which is one of varargs methods::

    from pyobjus import autoclass, objc_str

    NSArray = autoclass('NSArray')
    array = NSArray.arrayWithObjects_(objc_str('first string'), objc_str('second string'), None)

    text = array.objectAtIndex_(1)
    print text.UTF8String()

As you can see, last argument of varargs methods must be ``None``.

Using C array
-------------

In this section we will explain how to use C array from pyobjus.

Let's say that we made library ``CArrayTestlib.dylib``, which contains test functions for C array. Let's load it::

    import ctypes
    from pyobjus import autoclass, selector, dereference, CArray, CArrayCount
    from pyobjus.dylib_manager import load_dylib

    load_dylib('CArrayTestlib.dylib', usr_path=False)
    CArrayTestlib = autoclass("CArrayTestlib")
    _instance = CArrayTestlib.alloc()

Now we can call ``setIntValues:`` method::

    - (void) setIntValues:(int[10])val_arr
    {
        NSLog(@"Setting int array values...");
        memcpy(self->values, val_arr, sizeof(int) * 10);
        NSLog(@"Values copied...");
    }

on this way::

    nums = [0, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9] 
    array = (ctypes.c_int * 10)(*nums)  
    _instance.setIntValues_(array)

We can also return array values of this function::

    - (int*) getIntValues
    {
        if (!self->values)
        {
            NSLog(@"Values have not been set.");
            return NULL;
        }
        else
            return self->values;
    }

on this way::

    returned_PyList = dereference(_instance.getIntValues(), of_type=CArray, return_count=10)
    print returned_PyList

Note that here we passing ``return_count`` optional argument, which holds number of array items which are retured from ``getIntValues`` method.

But what if we don't know array count? In that case we need to have some argument in which method will put array count value.

Consider following method::

    - (int*) getIntValuesWithCount:(unsigned int*) n
    {
        NSLog(@" ... ... [+] getIntValuesWithCount(n=%zd)", n);
        NSLog(@" ... ... [+] *n=%zd", *n);
        if (!self->values)
        {
            NSLog(@"Values have not been set");
            return NULL;
        }
        else
        {
            *n = 10;
            NSLog(@" ... ... [+] getIntValuesWithCount(n=%zd)", n);
            NSLog(@" ... ... [+] *n=%zd", *n);
            return self->values;
        }
    }

First argument of this function will contain array count when return statement is reached. So let's call it::

    returned_PyList_withCount = dereference(_instance.getIntValuesWithCount_(CArrayCount), of_type=CArray)
    print returned_PyList_withCount

Pyobjus will internally read from that argument and convert returned C array to python array.

If method returns values/ArrayCount over reference and you don't provide ``CArrayCount``
on the right position in the method signature, you will get ``IndexError: tuple index out of range``
or segmentation fault, so don't forget to provide ``CArrayCount`` on the right position.

You may wonder, can you use multidimensional arrays from pyobjus? Yes, you can. Consider following method::

    - (void) set2DIntValues: (int[10][10]) val_arr
    {
        NSLog(@"Setting 2D int array values...");
        memcpy(self->int_2d_arr, val_arr, sizeof(int) * 10 * 10);
        NSLog(@"Values copied...");
    }
    - (int*) get2DIntValues
    {
        if (!self->int_2d_arr)
        {
            NSLog(@"Values have not been set for int 2d array.");
            return NULL;
        }
        else
        {
            return (int*)self->int_2d_arr;
        }
    }

To call this method first we need to make multidimensional array from python in this way::

    twoD_array = [
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
        [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20],
        [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30],
        [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40],
        [41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50],
        [51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60],
        [61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70],
        [71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80],
        [81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90],
        [91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100]
    ]

This will be representation of ``int[10][10]``, so let's call above method::

    _instance.set2DIntValues_(twoD_array)
    returned_2d_list = dereference(_instance.get2DIntValues(), of_type=CArray, partition=[10,10])
    print returned_2d_list

You can see optional ``partition`` argument of dereference function. Arguments contains format of C array. In this case it is ``[10, 10]``.
